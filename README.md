# HyperPLR: Hypergraph Generation through Projection, Learning, and Reconstruction

The dependency of the code is in ``requirement.txt``.

The framework can be found in ``main.ipynb``.

Some related method should be found in utils. (The algorithm ``GWC`` in the paper is implemented by function ``lazy_clique_edge_cover``)
